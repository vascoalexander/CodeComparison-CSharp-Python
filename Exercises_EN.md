# 1 Basics

### 1.1 Variables

#### Exercise 1.1.1

#### Exercise 1.1.2
Write a series of statements to declare a variable called **message** and initialize it with the value “hello”. Then change this variable to contain the value “how are you”. The program should output the content of the variable to the console after the change.

#### Exercise 1.1.3
Write a series of statements to declare 2 variables **x** and **y** and assign them the values 3 and 8.5. Then convert the type of these variables to strings.
The program should display the type of these variables at the end after the conversion.

#### Exercise 1.1.4
Write a program that asks the user for his weight in kilograms and stores it in a variable. The program should display the weight entered by the user at the end.

#### Exercise 1.1.5
Write a program that accepts two numbers from the user, adds the numbers and displays the result on the console.

#### Exercise 1.1.6
Write a program that accepts two numbers from the user, divides the numbers and displays the result on the console. What happens if the divisor is 0?
a) Use integer division  
b) Use floating point division  

#### Exercise 1.1.7

### 1.2 Conditionals

#### Exercise 1.2.1
Write a program with which you can check whether an entered integer is greater than 5. If so, an output is displayed on the console.

#### Exercise 1.2.2
Write a program that accepts a number from the user and outputs to the console if the number is even or odd.

#### Exercise 1.2.3

#### Exercise 1.2.4
You enter 7 numbers using the keyboard. At the end, the program displays the the largest number.

#### Exercise 1.2.5

#### Exercise 1.2.6
A bank proceeds according to the following rule:
If a customer has a balance of more than 1,000 euros in their current account or a balance of more than 1,500 euros in their savings account, no check fee is charged. Otherwise, a fee of 0.15 euros will be charged. Write a program that asks for the balance of the two accounts and then outputs how much the fee is.

#### Exercises 1.2.7
A parcel service charges 3.00 euros shipping costs up to a weight of
10 kilos (inclusive). Above this weight, an additional 0.25 euros must be paid for each kilo. Write a program that asks the user for the weight of the shipment and then displays the shipping costs.

Weight of the shipment: 11  
Shipping costs: 3.25 euros  

#### Exercise 1.2.8
Write a program to calculate values from Euro to DM and vice versa. The user should be asked for the amount and into which currency the amount should be converted. The character 'e' should be evaluated for the calculation DM -> Euro. If the character entered, is a different character, the calculation should be Euro -> DM.

The formula you need for this is Euro = DM/1.95583 or DM = Euro * 1.95583

#### Exercise 1.2.9
Change the program from exercise 1.2.7 in a way, that from a weight of 20 kilos, 0.50 euros must be paid for every kilo over 10 kilos.

Weight of the shipment: 25   
Shipping costs: 10.50 euros  

#### Exercise 1.2.10

Year of birth: 62  
Current year: 09  
Your age is: 47  

#### Exercise 1.2.11
Write a program to calculate leap years. Whether a year is a leap year depends on several conditions: If a year is divisible by 400 without a remainder, it is always a leap year. If a year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it is a leap year. In all other cases, it is not a leap year. Write a program that asks for a year number and then checks whether the year is a leap year. After the check, the program should output if it's a leap year or not.

#### Exercise 1.2.12
The manufacturer of a microwave oven recommends 50% more heating time when heating two portions and double the heating time when heating three portions. Heating more than three portions is not recommended. Write a program that asks the user for the number of portions and the heating time for one portion. The program will then output the recommended heating time. Note: Use four consecutive if queries without an else branch, each of them testing one of four cases: one serving, two servings, three servings, more than three servings.

#### Exercise 1.2.13
Sepp's petrol station is located on the A565 in Bonn on the edge of the Eifel. There is no other filling station for the next 200 kilometers. Write a program that helps drivers to decide whether they should refuel or not.

The program asks:  
- The tank capacity in liters  
- The fuel gauge in percent (full = 100, three-quarters full = 75, etc.)  
- The fuel consumption of the vehicle in km per liter.  

The output of the program is “Refuel!” or “Continue driving”, depending on whether the vehicle has enough fuel for 200 kilometers or not.

    Example:  
    Tank capacity: 12  
    Fuel gauge in %: 50  
    Fuel consumption km/l: 30

#### Exercise 1.3.20
Write a program that implements a guessing game:
The program selects a random number between 1 and 10. The player now has three attempts. As soon as the player enters the correct number, the program issues a message about winning the game and ends. If the player has not guessed the number after three attempts, the program issues a message about the failure and ends. You need the import statement with random, and the function random.randint(1, 10) which generates a random number between 1 and <= 10:

Here are two trial runs of the program:  

I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.  
You have three attempts to guess the number.  
Enter a number: 4 incorrect  
Enter a number: 8 CORRECT!  
You have won the game.  

I am thinking of a number between 1 and 10.  
You have three attempts to guess the number.

The correct number was 7.  
You have lost the game.

Write a program that displays the value of the keys 'apple' and 'banana' of the dictionary {'apple': 3, 'banana': 7, 'kiwi': 1} on the console.

#### Exercise 2.3.2
Write a program that sums the values of the following dictionary:
{'apple': 15, 'banana': 8, 'cutter': 12, 'kiwi': 9, 'peach': 2}

#### Exercise 2.3.3: 
Adding elements to a dictionary. The function addToDicitonary (elementKey, elementValue, d) takes 3 parameters: a dictionary **d**, a key **elementKey** and the corresponding value **elementValue**. The function should add this key and its value to the dictionary d. Finally, the function should return the dictionary d with the new key.

Verification:
```python
>> addToDictionary("baptiste", 29, {"julien": 14, "laurent":31})  
("julien": 14, "laurent" : 31, "baptiste": 29}  
>> addToDictionary("Gewicht", 65.3, {})  
("Gewicht": 65.3}  
```
